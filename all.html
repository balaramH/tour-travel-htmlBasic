                         epitomizes India’s strength, its democratic traditions and secular character.
                        Rashtrapati Bhavan was the creation of architects of exceptional imagination 
                        and masterfulness, Sir Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker. It was Sir Lutyens who 
                        conceptualized the H shaped building, covering an area of 5 acres on a 330 acre
                         estate. This mansion has a total of 340 rooms spread over four floors, 2.5 kilometres
                          of corridors and 190 acres of garden area.Painstaking efforts of thousands of
                           labourers including masons, carpenters, artists, carvers, and cutters saw the 
                       
                             the fashioning of the magnificent Rashtrapati Bhavan.”
                        When constructed, it was called the Viceroy’s House. The name changed to Government House
                         on August 15, 1947 when India became independent. Finally, its name was changed to
                          Rashtrapati Bhavan during the term of President Dr. Rajendra Prasad.

The design and construction were managed by Canadian engineer Rick Gregory, also of WS Atkins. Construction of the island began in 1994 and involved up to 2,000 construction workers during peak construction. It was built to resemble the billowing spinnaker sail of a J-class yacht.[15] Two "wings" spread in a V to form a vast "mast", while the space between them is enclosed in a massive atrium.

                        The hotel was built by South African construction contractor Murray & Roberts, now renamed Concor and Al Habtoor Engineering. The interior designs were led and created by Khuan Chew and John Coralan of KCA international and delivered by UAE based Depa

The Arabian Desert, one of the largest desertic areas in the world, offers some of the most suggestive landscapes in the world, attracting tourists and adrenaline seekers from all over the world. For a quintessential Dubai experience, you must go on a desert safari with dune bashing – the Arab version of sand duning, which involves driving at very fast speeds on very bumpy sand dunes, and of course, enjoy some incredible sandboarding on one of the countless sand red dunes in the area.
